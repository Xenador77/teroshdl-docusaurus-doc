# Integrations

## Installation
Not all third-party tools, frameworks, or simulators are automatically installed by TerosHDL as that would involve wasting large amounts of precious disk space.  
**Instead**:
* simply install any supported integrations you want to use with the VSCode extension
* Add the installation directories of any that aren't on your $PATH to extension settings

:::caution
Specify the **directory** of the binary:
* /opt/intelFPGA_pro/20.1/modelsim_ase/bin
* C:\Users\JoDo\.apio\packages\tools-oss-cad-suite\bin\

**Not** the binary itself:
 * /home/Hamburgler27/intelFPGA_pro/20.1/modelsim_ase/bin/modelsim
 * C:\Users\JanDo\.apio\packages\tools-oss-cad-suite\bin\yosys.exe
