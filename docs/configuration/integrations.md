# Integrations

## Installation
Third-party simulators, tools and frameworks aren\'t automatically installed by TerosHDL, as that could lead to redundant installs, and would involve wasting large amounts of precious disk space.  Instead, simply install any supported integrations you want/need, then add the installation directories of any that aren't on your system $PATH to the TerosHDL config

## Custom Paths

:::tip specify the directory of the binary:

-  /opt/intelFPGA_pro/20.1/modelsim_ase/bin
-  C:\Users\JonDough\.apio\packages\tools-oss-cad-suite\bin\

:::

:::warning DON'T specify the binary itself:

-  C:\Users\JaneDough\.apio\packages\tools-oss-cad-suite\bin\yosys.exe
-  /home/Hamburgler27/intelFPGA_pro/20.1/modelsim_ase/bin/modelsim
