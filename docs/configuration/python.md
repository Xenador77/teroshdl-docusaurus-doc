Example custom path in Windows:

`C:\Users\Ron\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32`
(Be careful with the blank spaces.)
# Example with Anaconda

`conda activate my_en; python`

**If you use Windows you have to replace \';\' by \'&\'**

# Example with virtualenv

`. .venv/bin/activate; python`

**If you use Windows you have to replace \';\' by \'&\'**
