# Checking errors
Once configuration was performed correctly, TerosHDL will route all errors from your chosen linter to VScodes built in error system.

Errors detected will be shown with red squigglies.

Hovering over the error will show the linters reported issue:

You can also see all of the errors in all of the currently open files under the <i>Problems</i> tab:
