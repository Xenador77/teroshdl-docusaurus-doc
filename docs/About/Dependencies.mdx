#Dependencies
In order for the tools to be automatically managed by the TerosHDL VS-Code extension, a few dependencies must be installed: 

* Python3
  * Install directory can be configured in the TerosHDL extension settings.
* Once python3 is installed and added to path, the following command will install the necessary libraries 
  (Windows users, replace 'pip3' with 'pip'): 
  ```py
  pip3 install teroshdl
  ```
* Or install VUnit, Edalize, and YoWASP-Yosys manually: 
  ```py
  pip3 install vunit-hdl vsg yowasp-yosys edalize
  ```
* Then install Make:
  * [Linux](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) 
  * [Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)

Simulators aren't included in TerosHDL, to simulate your designs you need to install your preferred simulator and configure it properly in the extension settings
