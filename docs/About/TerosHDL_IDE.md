#TerosHDL_IDE

The goal of TerosHDL is to provide an open source IDE for HDL developers with functionalities commonly used by software developers. TerosHDL consists of a combination of tools developed by Teros Technology, and a curated collection of open source toolchains/framework integrations, organized by backend and exposed to the GUI within the extension.

The IDE tries to be self-contained and to simplify the installation process when and where possible, but some initial setup is required.
