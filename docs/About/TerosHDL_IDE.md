# TerosHDL IDE

The goal of TerosHDL is to provide an open source IDE for HDL developers with functionalities commonly used by software developers. TerosHDL consists of a combination of tools developed by [Teros
Technology](https://github.com/TerosTechnology), and a [curated collection](thanks_to) of open source toolchains/framework integrations, organized by backend and exposed to the GUI within a single [VS-Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teros-technology.teroshdl).

The IDE tries to be self-contained and to simplify the installation process when and where possible, but some initial setup is required.
