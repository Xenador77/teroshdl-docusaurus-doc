The goal of TerosHDL is to provide an open source IDE for HDL devlopers
with functionalities commonly used by software developers. The IDE
consist in a bunch of tools and of top of them is the [VSCode
plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teros-technology.teroshdl).
Some tools are developed by [Teros
Technology](https://github.com/TerosTechnology) organization and others
come from open source proyects. All the tools are organized in different
backends and exposed to the GUI with the plugin.

The IDE tries to be as much self-contained as possible and simplify the
installation process.
