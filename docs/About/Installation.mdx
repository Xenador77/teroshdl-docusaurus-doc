# Dependencies
In order for the tools to be automatically managed by the TerosHDL VS-Code extension, a few dependencies must be installed:
## Python3
* [How to install Python3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
  * Once installed (and on path), specify the install directory in the TerosHDL extension settings
:::tip
More information about configuring Python3 to work with TerosHDL [here](../configuration/python)
:::
#### Required Python Packages
  * Now that Python is setup we can run the following to install the necessary libraries:
  ```shell
  pip3 install teroshdl
  ```
  * Or install VUnit, Edalize, and YoWASP-Yosys manually: 
  
  ```shell
  pip3 install vunit-hdl vsg yowasp-yosys edalize
  ```

:::tip
Windows users, replace 'pip3' with 'pip'

## Make:
  * [Install Make on Linux](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) 
  * [Install Make on Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
## Simulators
  * Simulators aren't automatically installed via the TerosHDL_IDE.
    * To simulate your designs you need to install your preferred simulator and configure it properly in the extension settings
