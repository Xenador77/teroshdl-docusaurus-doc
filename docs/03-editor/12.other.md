## Show hidden characters

Sometimes you may also need to display hidden characters - such as spaces or tabs - in the code editor:

- Solution 1:

The fastest way is to press `F1` and type `Toggle Render Whitespace` in the input field that appears. Hint, if you just type `render` that might be enough. Select the option and toggle the value by pressing `Enter` . 

- Solution 2:

Open the settings panel. File --> Preferences -> Settings In the search box, type `render whitespace`. Then select the all option if you want to see the tabs and spaces everywhere.

## Side by side editing

Keyboard Shortcut: `Ctrl+\`

You can also drag and drop editors to create new editor groups and move editors between groups.

## Move lines

To move a line of code up or down in Visual Studio Code first go to the line you want to move and then use the `ALT + ↑ or ALT + ↓` . You can also move up or down multiple lines at once by selecting the lines first and then using the keyboard shortcut.
