# Checking problems
Once configuration was performed correctly, TerosHDL will route all errors from your chosen style-checker to VScodes built in error system.


Problems detected will be shown with yellows squigglies.

Hovering over the error will show the linters reported issue:

You can also see all of the errors in all of the currently open files under the <i>Problems</i> tab:
